**My name's Tomáš. I live somewhere between Karlštejn and Křivoklát. I help online projects reach their goals. Family, gardening, forests, books, and music make me happy. I can't imagine working on my computer without my AutoHotkey script.**

> If there are programs or files you need to access regularly, you can put them in your Start menu (or equivalent), or even better, develop an Autohotkey for it. Then turn off your desktop icons, and get a nice serene desktop pic (I have a Zen garden pic). Another tip: don’t have a bunch of programs open at once. Work on one task at a time, and only have the window(s) open that you need to work on that task.
